# Scheduling Program 

## Purpose 
The purpose of this application is to enable customers in different countries to schedule meetings with an American based company during the companyâ€™s hours of operation. Each table has its own functionality and purpose. The customer has the ability to schedule appointments with various contacts, assuming the appointment is within business hours and does not conflict with other appointments at that time.

## Description
I designed and implemented a database, using MySQL (workbench) and SQL, for a scheduling application. The application was built primarily with Java, utilizing JDBC to allow the app to communicate with the database, to process SQL statements and execute queries. JavaFX Library and SceneBuilder were used to make a more aesthetically pleasing interface. 

The database schema consists of basic tables that house data for appointments, contacts (company employees), customers, country information, first-level division information (depending on the country, division may mean state, province, territory, or region - which helps to determine which language to set the Login & Main Menu screens of the application to, as well as the time zones based on location), and users (database access [employee login] information).
